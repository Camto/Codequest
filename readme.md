The files here are:

* `cq_template.py` - This is the template to base all our answers off of. It contains basic imports and utility functions.
* `cq_template_fancy.py` - A more commented and spacious version of `cq_template.py`.
* `Answers/<year>/<problem #>.py` - These are the answers written for that year.
* `Answers/<year>/tst.py` - This is the answer submission testing file for that year.
* `Remade/<year>/*.py` - These are the year's files rewritten to be cleaner.
